# ProjectWorks
This is where I store my past projects. 

For each of the projects, the files are under their respective folders, and below are some description about each of the projects:

1. CreditDefaultClassificationFinalProject

This is a credit default classification project done with 3 other coursemates. We explored decision tree model, neural network, SVM and logistics regression for the dataset, and performed exploratory data visualization, feature selection and model training and
evaluation for our final proposed model. 

2. LibraryDatabaseSystem

This is a database system that we designed in a team of 4 for the project in another module of mine. We developed the database based on relational database using MySQL and our interface using Python TKinter. 

3. VisualisingCovid19

This is a project of visualising the trends of Covid-19 spread and infection in the early days of Covid-19. I utilised my skills in Ggplot2 package in r to complete the visualisations. 

4. TitanicMachineLearningCompetitionKaggle

This is an online platform (Kaggle) machine learning competition that I currently enrolled in. Currently, I have not uploaded any documents related to it but I will be doing t soon after I come up with my best performing model.
